# Book Nookery

Book Nookery is an online bookshop crafted for book lovers to browse and purchase books with ease. The site allows shoppers to explore a selection of books by category, and view detailed information on each book. Users can easily contact the shop with questions and leave reviews on books they've read.

For registered users, the site provides a personalised account experience, offering quick registration, login, profile management, and access to order history. Shoppers can save books to a wishlist, search by title, author, or description, and sort results by various criteria, such as price, to find specific genres or books within their budget.

The checkout process is streamlined, allowing shoppers to review and adjust items in their cart, securely enter payment details, and receive order confirmations. For shop owners, the platform supports simple inventory management, including adding, updating, and removing books, along with real-time stock display.
